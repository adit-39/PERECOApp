Personal Emergency Response Ecosystem
This project aims to provide a distributed system for detection of Natural Disasters based on geofence created. If a user has the broadcast receiver app installed, he may be notified as being in the geofence and hence in danger, or outside the zone and safe.
If in Danger, the server navigates the device to a nearby safe spot and provides feature of reporting obstacles in the route to the safe spot so that they can be re-routed.
